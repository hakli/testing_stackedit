# Testing StackEdit

How does it work? So far so good. But can I use Pandoc with this?
*Hi*

Ok, let's see. I've connected this to GitHub now (because I wasn't able to connect it to the University GitLab). How does it work now? 

Now I found a helpful link that explained how to connect StackEdit to GitLab so let's see if this works: https://dev.to/maxwhite20062003/how-to-link-your-gitlab-account-to-stackedit-2pkc

Seems to work! Or at least it didn't give the usual 404 error.

However, StackEdit seems to require Google account for signing in and for becoming a sponsor, so we can't use it without Google and I would prefer not to share with Google everything we write. I think we cannot use StackEdit for our group work after all :(

Too bad, since I would have loved to have a collaborative MarkDown editor with GitLab and Pandoc support and this is the only one I've found.

The problem with lack of GitLab support, on the other hand, means that we will have to share everything we write with MicroSoft. Out of the frying pan and into the fire.
