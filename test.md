# Testing StackEdit

How does it work? So far so good. But can I use Pandoc with this?

Ok, let's see. I've connected this to GitHub now (because I wasn't able to connect it to the University GitLab). How does it work now? 

Now I found a helpful link that explained how to connect StackEdit to GitLab so let's see if this works: https://dev.to/maxwhite20062003/how-to-link-your-gitlab-account-to-stackedit-2pkc

Seems to work! Or at least it didn't give the usual 404 error.

However, StackEdit seems to require Google account for signing in and for becoming a sponsor, so we can't use it without Google and I would prefer not to share with Google everything we write. I think we cannot use StackEdit for our group work after all :(

Too bad, since I would have loved to have a system with
